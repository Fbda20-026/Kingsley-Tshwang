				<h2>History of Paris France</h2>
				<p>The history of Paris dates back to approximately 259 BC, with the 
				Parisii, a Celtic tribe settled on the banks of the Seine. In 52 BC, the fishermen 
				village was conquered by the Romans, founding a Gallo-Roman town called Lutetia.

The city changed its name to Paris during the fourth century. During this period, the city was threatened 
y Attila the Hun and his army, and according to the legend, the inhabitants of Paris resisted the attacks 
thanks to the providential intervention of Saint Genevi√®ve (patron saint of the city).

In 508 the first king of the Franks, Clovis I, made Paris the capital of his empire. In 987, the Capetian
 dynasty came to power until 1328.

During the eleventh century, Paris gradually became more prosper thanks to its trade in silver and because 
it was a strategic route for pilgrims and traders.</p><br><br><br><br>
